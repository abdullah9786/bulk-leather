## File Size Recommendations

- **Dimensions**: 1920x1080 or smaller
- **Format**: JPG for photos, PNG for graphics

### Videos
- **Maximum**: 100 MB (for direct hosting)
- **Recommended**: Use YouTube/Vimeo for large files
- **Resolution**: 1080p maximum
- **Format**: MP4 (H.264 codec)

### Thumbnails (for videos)
- **Size**: 100-300 KB
- **Dimensions**: 1280x720 or 1920x1080
- **Format**: JPG

## Testing Your URLs

### Image URL Test
A valid image URL should:
- End with image extension (`.jpg`, `.png`, `.webp`)
- Load directly in browser when pasted in address bar
- Not redirect to a page with ads or preview

### Video URL Test
A valid video URL should:
- Be playable in HTML5 video player
- Have CORS enabled (for self-hosted)
- Work in incognito/private mode

### Quick Test in Browser
```javascript
// For images
<img src="YOUR_IMAGE_URL" />

// For videos  
<video src="YOUR_VIDEO_URL" controls />
```

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "Failed to load resource: net::ERR_BLOCKED_BY_CLIENT"
**Solution**: URL is being blocked by ad blocker. Use a different hosting service.

### Issue: "No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header"
**Solution**: CORS issue. Use a CDN or hosting service that allows cross-origin requests.

### Issue: Video won't play
**Solution**: 
- Check video format (MP4 with H.264 is most compatible)
- Ensure URL is direct link, not a page embedding the video
- For YouTube, consider using embedded URL

### Issue: Image shows but video doesn't
**Solution**: Video hosting is stricter than image hosting. Consider using YouTube or Vimeo.

## Best Practices

1. **Optimize Before Upload**
   - Compress images with tools like TinyPNG
   - Use appropriate resolution (don't upload 4K for web)
   - Convert to web-friendly formats

2. **Use Consistent Hosting**
   - Keep all media on same service when possible
   - Easier to manage and maintain
   - Better for analytics and monitoring

3. **Backup URLs**
   - Keep a spreadsheet of all media URLs
   - Document what each URL points to
   - Track upload dates

4. **Test on Multiple Devices**
   - Check loading speed on mobile
   - Verify playback on different browsers
   - Test with slower internet connection

5. **Create Quality Thumbnails**
   - Always provide thumbnails for videos
   - Use clear, well-lit screenshots
   - Ensure thumbnail represents the content

## Example Workflow

### For Images (Factory Tour)
1. Take high-quality photos with camera/phone
2. Edit/crop as needed
3. Compress to ~500KB using TinyPNG
4. Upload to Imgur or Cloudinary
5. Copy direct URL
6. Add to gallery via admin dashboard
7. Select "Factory Tour" category
8. Add relevant tags (e.g., "workshop", "machinery")

### For Videos (Manufacturing Process)
1. Record video (1080p, MP4)
2. Edit and trim to 1-3 minutes
3. Upload to YouTube (can be unlisted)
4. Copy YouTube URL
5. Take screenshot for thumbnail
6. Upload thumbnail to Imgur
7. Add both URLs to gallery
8. Select "Manufacturing" category
9. Add descriptive title and tags
